/**
 * Order sets are used to pre-define sets of orders in order to make the
 * ordering process easier i.e., pick from a list instead of having to manually
 * enter orders for common orders or groups of orders. Order sets can contain
 * 0-to-n members; each member can be a reference to an order-able concept, an
 * order template (pre-defined order), or another order set. Order set is a
 * definition of one or more related orders – e.g.,
 * "orders to consider when a patient presents with pneumonia" or
 * "common ways to order Penicillin", where someone may be picking & choosing
 * from the set of orders. Order group is a set of actual orders that are
 * grouped from some reason (e.g., they were ordered from a pre-defined order
 * set OR we come up with other reasons to group orders). For example, you might
 * define an order set FIRST LINE HIV THERAPIES that described two recommended
 * starting regimens, each of which contained three drugs. You haven't ordered
 * anything for any patient; rather, you've just created metadata defining the
 * set of orders to be considered in a specific situation. Later, a doctor in
 * the midst of placing orders for a patient finds your order set and uses it to
 * select the 2nd regimen. Three drugs (the three in the 2nd regimen) are added
 * to the orders table for the patient and marked as being in an order group
 * (basically tagging those orders as being created from your order set). The
 * order group – much like an obs group – is a grouping mechanism of actual
 * orders for a patient.
